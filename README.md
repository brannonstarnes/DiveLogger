# Navy Dive Logs

## About

Simplifiying diving protocols, achieving fast and accurate calculations, and delivering clear, concise options to the diving supervisor when every second counts. Navy Dive Logs is developed by a First Class Navy Diver and uses the most current edition of the US Navy Diving Manual as the backbone for every line of code. My hope is that my programs will contribute to safer dive planning, rapid and informed time-critical decision-making , and streamlined dive records reporting.
