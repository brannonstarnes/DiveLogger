# Navy Dive Logger (Work in Progress)

After reading below, watch the demo [here](https://youtu.be/Cg6KkvD50sw)! Be sure to open in a new tab.

## About

Simplifiying diving protocols, achieving fast and accurate calculations, and delivering clear, concise options to the diving supervisor when every second counts. Navy Dive Logger is developed by a First Class Navy Diver and uses the most current edition of the US Navy Diving Manual as the backbone for every line of code. My hope is that this application will contribute to safer dive planning, rapid and informed time-critical decision-making , and streamlined dive records reporting.

## Vision

The following items represent my feature implementation intentions:

- Supervisor's stopwatch with diving-event buttons
- Auto-filling dive log
- Export/ Email completed dive log
- Scuba bottle duration calculator
- Live Decompression Table calculation/notification
- Live Warnings/Suggestions to inform diving supervisor's course of action
  - Warnings/Suggestions will contain references to current US Navy Diving Manual page/paragraph for course of action
- Auth0 login 
- Persistent user profile
- Database to hold/retrieve diver profiles, history of dive logs 

## Tech Stack (will be added to as needed)

- React Native
  - iOS (first) / Android (next)
  - (Currently being developed/tested on iPhone 8+)
- TypeScript
- Expo
